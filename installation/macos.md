## Mac App Store
The easiest way to install UTM is from the Mac App Store.

[ Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817){: .btn .btn-green }

## GitHub
You can also download the latest stable version of UTM from GitHub.

[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg){: .btn .btn-green }

## Homebrew
For command line users, you can install UTM with Homebrew which also uses the latest stable version from GitHub.

brew install --cask utm
```

{: .note }
UTM is and always will be completely free and open source. The Mac App Store version is identical to the GitHub version and there are no features left out. The only advantage of the Mac App Store version is that you can get automatic updates. Purchasing the App Store version directly funds the development of UTM and shows your support ♥.

### Beta
If you want the latest bleeding edge build, check out the [releases page](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases) for the latest beta build.

### Installation
Open the DMG and drag the icon on the left to the folder on the right. To update UTM, you can just replace the existing installation and all your virtual machines will be retained.
